                  `Welcome! Today we're going to be talking about the fastest way to
            learn Chess. We'll be discussing some topics such as control the center, develop your pieces,
            Protect your King, Active pieces,Your Opponent's move and finally Phases of the game in
             each consecutive paragraphs.`,
                  `Put your pieces in the ideal position to control the most important part of the board—the
            center. Try to attack those squares, e4, d4, e5 and d5 early in the game. If you can control
            those squares, your opponent won't be able to find good squares for his or her pieces.`,
                  `Take control of the game by developing your pieces rapidly to squares where they control 
            the center. You want to develop your knights and bishops and castle quickly. Once you've done that, 
            it's time to move the queen and connect the rooks. This is a great goal for the opening.`,
                  `King safety is the most important positional factor in chess. Usually, the best way to 
            secure your king is to castle. That way you can use your center pawns to fight for the center, 
            but keep your side pawns back to protect the king in a castled position. Another great aspect 
            of castling is that it helps your rook fight for the center.`,
                  `An active piece has the potential to make many moves. At the start of the game, most pieces 
            can't move at all, and the knights can only move to two squares each. The best way to get pieces 
            active is to move them towards the center of the board.`,
                  `It’s important to pay attention to what your opponent is trying to do each turn. You want 
            to watch out for any checks, captures, or threats that the opponent might make. Those are the moves 
            that are likely to get you in trouble if you don’t see them coming. Sometimes your opponent will 
            make more than one threat, and you’ll want to find a move that defends everything, so take your 
            time to look at multiple ideas.`,
                  `Chess games typically feature three phases. The opening is when each side focuses on 
            developing their pieces from the back rank. Once most pieces are developed we reach the middle-game, 
            where both sides attempt to improve their positions and still have most of their pieces. If no one 
            has won yet, the game enters an endgame where each side has just a few pieces and most likely players 
            will try to promote a pawn and then checkmate.`,

                  `In this article, we're going to be talking looking at the values of the various pieces 
                  int the game of chess. We'll be talking about each of the pieces starting from Bishops,
                  Knights, Rook, King, Queen and finally pawns. Also see how they all work together.`,
                  `BISHOP - Bishops are most useful when controlling long, unblocked diagonals. Bishops are particularly useful when you have both of them, so they can control both light and dark squares.`,
                  `KNIGHT - Knights are best in the center, where they can control up to eight squares. Knights work well with queens and also do a good job blocking pawns.`,
                  `ROOK - Put your rooks on open files, where they won't be blocked by pawns. Rooks are also good on semi-open files, attacking opposing pawns or defending your pawns. Rooks are effective in batteries, working together on an open rank or file, especially the 7th rank.`,
                  `KING - Early in the game you will want to castle the king to safety. In the endgame, you want to use the king to help escort pawns up the board. When it can't be checkmated, the king can be a strong piece!`,
                  `QUEEN - Queens are very powerful, but you must be careful not to lose her for less valuable pieces. For that reason, queens often develop a little later than other pieces. The best use of a queen is to target the opposing king with help from other pieces, `,
                  `PAWN - Pawns have four primary uses. 1. Pawns can control key squares, such as the center. If your pawns control the center the opponent won't be able to put pieces on good squares. 2. Pawns are also helpful protecting your own pieces so they cannot be captured. 3. Pawns are useful as battering rams to open a path to the opposing king. 4. Pawns are good for promoting into more powerful pieces.`,
                  `Like in team sports, all of your pieces should work together for success in chess! One powerful piece will not be able to compete with many pieces working together.`,

                  `Today, in this article I would like to talk about something which scares every player in the game
                  of chess  => CHECKMATE . Here we will discuss about How can you force checkmates and win games?`,
                  `PAWN RACE - When both sides only have kings and pawns it's essential to count how many moves each side will take to promote. Usually whoever gets there first will win the game!`,
                  `CHECKMATE IN TWO MOVES -  It's helpful to look at all of the checks for each side and see if there are checkmates or other tactics available on the next move.`,
                  `DON'T JUST CHECK - Attacking the king is great - but it's not always the right move. Be patient. Make sure that a check accomplishes a goal, like helping to mate or preventing your opponent from castling. If your opponent has a useful move to get out of check, it's probably not worth it.`,
                  `KING SAFETY - Never forget to protect your most important piece, the king. A material advantage doesn't matter if there's checkmate. Be careful to defend potential checkmating squares near your king and to give your king escape routes if needed.`,
                  `WEAK TARGETS f2 AND f7 - The f2 and f7 pawns are only defended by the king in the starting position, so it can be subject to attack. If you can attack your opponent's f-pawn with two pieces when it's only defended by a king you can frequently win material or checkmate. A good defensive idea is to castle so that your rook defends the f-pawn.`,
                  `BACK RANK CHECKMATES - Castling is a good idea, but if the king is on the back rank without other pieces to defend it, it may be vulnerable to a back rank checkmate from a rook or queen. It's often a good idea to advance one pawn in front of the king to create an escape square and avoid mate.`,

            In the same context, we are today learning how the six pieces move, attack and defend in the game of chess.
            Lets get started now !`,
              `KING - Kings move one square in any direction, so long as that square is not attacked by an enemy piece. Additionally, kings are able to make a special move, known as castling. `,
              `QUEEN - Queens move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces.`,
              `ROOK - Rooks move horizontally or vertically any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces. Rooks move when the king castles.`,
              `BISHOP - Bishops move diagonally any number of squares. They are unable to jump over pieces.`,
              `KNIGHTS - Knights move in an ‘L’ shape’: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, then move one square horizontally or vertically. They are the only piece able to jump over other pieces.`,
              `PAWN - Pawns move vertically forward one square, with the option to move two squares if they have not yet moved. Pawns are the only piece to capture different to how they move. The pawns capture one square diagonally in a forward direction.
              Pawns are unable to move backward on captures or moves. Upon reaching the other side of the board a pawn promotes into any other piece, except for a king. Additionally, pawns can make a special move named En Passant.`,
              `Almost every person in the world knows the famous board game of chess! However, many look at the chessboard and feel totally overwhelmed, thinking that it is a game only for extraordinarily smart people and a game they could never understand. They look at the black and white chessboard, see 32 chess pieces that they don’t know the names of, and have no idea what to do with them.`,
